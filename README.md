# Calculator
This repository contains a mini project for building a simple calculator as part of my programming practice. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, providing a user-friendly command-line interface. It serves as a learning exercise to enhance my coding skills and understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
